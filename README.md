Songs-the-lord-gave-dave

Songs hand picked by The Lord, put in Dave's brain, and from there turned into songs.
Then unto Dave the Lord sayeth, "Make a website, with aos scroll animations, blotterjs text animations, and use APlayer to create a playlist.", and so it shall be.

Dave then set to work for literally hours for week until the website was somewhat functional, and occasionally loads correctly. 
The Lord did not approve of Dave's haphazard style of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. He sayeth unto Dave "Do better or you shall know my fury as you have known my love. To do something halfway is to refuse God.", and so it shall be.

Dave quit his job and is now living in his 2008 Toyota Prius. He spends his days at various Starbucks and cafes working on this non-monetary project because the Lord said so.
A regular old Job, is this Dave. Working diligently with only his faith and his Lenovo Flex 14" Ideapad to guide him.
