Songs-the-lord-gave-dave

Songs hand picked by The Lord, put in Dave's brain, and from there turned into songs.
Then unto Dave the Lord sayeth, "Make a website, with aos scroll animation, blotterjs text animation, and add songs to it.", and so it shall be.

Dave then set to work for literally hours for week until the website was somewhat functional, and occasionally loaded most of the content correctly. 

The Lord did not approve of Dave's haphazard style of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. He sayeth unto Dave "Do better or you shall know my fury as you have known my love. To do something halfway is to refuse God.", and so it shall be.

Dave quit his job and is now living in his 2008 Toyota Prius. He spends his days at various Starbucks locations, drinking free cups of water and bathing in the bathroom sink. He uses his laptop with 4gb ram to work on this website. He hopes that it will soon please the Lord, so that he can once again get a job and live indoors.
