# Stole Us A Car

We went to the junkyard and found a matching body

We got the vin # and stole us a car

We got it fully insured and we set it on fire

We took the insurance money and bought us a choir

And the choir sang::

*da da da da da da da da da da da da* (D-G-A)

# Heart to No Heart

You can't have a heart to heart with a man that ain't got no heart

You'll end up at the start, frustrated.

# Mel the Lonely

Once upon a time before the chaos of Everything,

There was darkness. From the shadow of the Inconceivable Creator.

His name was Mel and he had a large white beard, 

where he came from nobody on Earth really knows.

Mel was very big. Inconceivably Big! 

He was bigger than the Earth, Moon, Stars, and Everything else. 

He was bigger than the whole universe!

But he was all alone and got bored with nothing to do but think all the time. 

# Swami

The cities local Swami 

and morning talk show personality

said "Twenty years from now is after the end times."

And "Things will be radically different"

"How different? It's hard to say. 

But this will be as good a place as any to stay."

# Dostoevsky

I'm beginning to hear voices

And I don't know if they're really there. 

Turns out it's just Dostoevsky

Oh, it's just Dostoevsky

# Colorado

I'm gonna move to the backwoods of Colorado.

Just the lady and the baby and the dog and me.

# Leaves

Force leaves from a dead tree

Set it on fire and pull up a seat

# Ain't Unaccustomed

I ain't unaccustomed to mowing some grass

and I ain't unaccustomed to whuppin some ass.

I do what I gotta do in this world to get by

I work every hour till my hands they can't pry

> Open with plyers and hammers and nails

> If John Deere ain't in heaven I'm goin to hell

# Clipped Your Wings

You say I've clipped your wings, but I have done no such thing.

You are the one that doesn't want me to fly. 

# Cold Feet

Everybody I know is breaking up or alone. Sad, poor people. 

It's been a rough year for us all. It was very cold this winter. 

It's spring now and it's and chilly. Everybody has cold feet.

# Kill the Splinters

The decline and fall of your desire, 

Melancholy sings the choir

It's a sad song and it makes you tired

There's a black rainbow up on the horizon

It's ok to look at it's mesmorizin'

Topple the timbers to kill all the splinters

Go home and drain your blood blisters

# Exotic Pets

Exotic pets, sitting in the windows

Very interesting animals.

Mainly due to their unfamiliarity...the exotic-ness of them.

Not the kind of animal you see every day, like a dog or a horse

# Pie

You're fat and stoned.

You're eating a piece of pie. 

As you lay on the couch watching the time go by. 

# You Don't Seem to Care Anymore

You don't seem to care anymore.

There's dog shit on the floor. 

It's been there for hours and you haven't picked it up. 

You don't seem to care anymore.

# Reason

*The reason of the unreasonable treatment of my reason enfeebles my reason in such wise that with reason I complain of your beauty*

-Feliciano de Silva

# Whiplashes

Crystal glasses hip whiplashes sewing classes 6 more lashes.

The daytime came too late. 

# Climbing the Ladder

Today I was called a "friendly Hitler". 

Sorry, but I'm the manager. 

I was given a training book by my boss. 

It's long and drawn, it's 8 chapters long

My job is shit, I work like hell

My hair turns white, no tales to tell

I lose my connections, I lose the thrill

I make more money, I climb the hill

I start talkin' like them, it makes me ill

# Puzzle Place

I know something that I want to share, 

I know somewhere let me take you there. 

Come along with me to find it - it's everywhere!!!

The Puzzle Place - The Puzzle Place  

We're going up to the Puzzle Place

# Your Hair Smells Like Apples

The record player crackles 

I bet your hair smells sweet like apples

This is the way it's supposed to be

Like a hungry hog gettin' feed

These are the things I forgot I need

These are the things that make me bleed

​	An October breeze just before noon

​	The record player sings from my room

​	Guitar picks me up and plays a tune

​	Sittin' on the porch waitin' for the moon

​	Sing an old song, it sounds like you

This old chunk of coal regaining hope 

I want to take you out, someplace we can smoke

We'll fall in love in the spring,

Get married under a red maple tree

In the winter you'll wear baby blue

By the fireside you'll give me something to hold onto 

​	You might break my heart in a year or two

​	But I'll do everything to keep ahold of you

​	I'll enjoy you darlin' while you're here

​	I'll treat you like I ought to, now that's sincere

​	I can't quit grinnin' from ear to ear

​	I've lost my mind it's in the rearview mirror

​	please don't break this old heart, dear

I don't know you, but you're just my type

I'm watchin' you ride your bike.

I'm right behind you all the time.

At the store, in your car, wherever you go I'm never far.

At your job you won't need one soon, I can take care of you.

Someday I'll say hello to you, and start the rest of our life.

One of these days you'll be my wife.

# Umbrella for Two

All I ever had was a walk in the woods

Umbrella for two, in the rain with you

You were all I ever had, a stroll in the park

Four sugars for you and four for me too

​	the night is good to me, she swept me up in her breeze

​	I've locked the devil's gate and thrown away the keys

# Talkin' on the Phone

I lost the highway a little while ago

But I'm makin' it my way, I know I move slow

​	I'm in this thing alone

​	I guess you're doin' fine on your own. 

​	Every time I see you I'm gone

​	You act like a twelve year old

​	All you want to do is talk on the phone

​	We're getting nowhere and its been so long

​	Every single time, every single time

I've got something in layaway, I never picked it up

I've still got the receipt, it's been over a month

​	I'm in this thing alone

​	I guess you're doin' fine on your own. 

​	Every time I see you I'm gone

​	You act like a twelve year old

​	All you want to do is talk on the phone

​	We're getting nowhere and its been so long

​	Every single time, every single time

Every time I see you I'm gone, Every time I see you I'm gone

# Backwards Widows

The crooked trees have fallen leaves 

 the backwards widows are begging please

Let me out of sideways pain

The heathens will strike again

Save the smoke that goes to waste

Sell it off in bad taste

>Spineless dames with no last names
>
>gathering round to complain 
>
>spattering low on wasted days
>
>walking around staring at the ground talking to themselves but they don't make a sound
>
>they only hear what you think you say
>
>it rings in their ears and it won't go away

# Genesis 1 - 7

(E-G-D-C)

Dammed be the woman. Apologize for the sins of Eve

I came from the dirt and you're a part of me

But your soul will never be free

> Damned be the brother, for sticking a knife into me
>
> My offerings were best so you laid me to rest
>
> But your soul will never be free

Nine hundred and thirty years old before his blood turned cold

and his blood still bleeds from you and me as we kneel and talk at the moon

> Damn is the wicked man, you have destroyed the earth 
>
> When the waters descend and cover the land
>
> You'll return to the place of your birth

# Sad Man

He's come back home and the alcohol is roaring through his veins

He's spent the last year wondering if he's gone insane

​	Living in hotels and buying his women,

​	too many sins to be forgiven. 

​	Give the boy what he's wantin',

​	He ain't hidin' nothin' but everything.

Anxiety pills and overdue bills keep his brain from boiling.

His loneliness and unknown kids, keep him from seeing life as something worth enjoying

​	He used to make about twelve dollars an hour,

​	he wasn't rich but he wasn't sour.

​	Give the boy what he's wanting,

He ain't hiding nothing but everything

____

If you ask him he'll say he's doing alright

but he's so messed up he can't sleep at night.

He needs a little woman to hold him tight

but if he had one he wouldn't treat her right

He's a sad sad man

____

The day before tomorrow came unwelcome

Wishes he could get back to better days

​	He used to have a love in his life

​	Before he went out on her every night 

​	Give the boy what he's wanting

​	He ain't hiding nothing but everything

____

Wakes up in the morning with a pound of pain

weighing him down and making him strain

just to get up and face the day,

Standing right here a million miles away. 

He's a sad sad man

# Live Your Life

Live your life, don't fake it

If you've got love, then make it

Get some new shoes, stop singing the blues

Quit your job on Sunday, you don't need it. 

If you've got the urge, then go out and feed it

​	Stop paying rent go live in a tent.

you sway to the left and sway to the right
then slide to the left and slide to the right

girls, boys, and whatevers, 
everybody put your gloves together 
girls or boys or after or before
boys and girls and in-betweens
gettin' lit in Tarpon Springs
so drunk . the likes of which you've never seen 
relaxing in a virtual reality neon green limousine
the whole thing decked out, 
from bumper to bumper,
from seam to seam
everything is everything
you are more than part of a human being
you are in charge of the whole entire thing ,
you are something, 
the likes of which i've never seen
women men or whenever
you make me want to say whatever, 
i give up. 
​	i love u.  
​		i surrender
come sleep with me, lets rub our masks together
come sleep with me , all November 
come sleep with me , all December
November breakdown 
ximi ximi ximi
December broke down 
fine fine fine
January meltdown 
ximi fine ximi
February throughTheGround 

x. ADIOS... for now! 
I'm almost certain we'll see each other again in heaven. 
This life is short, and the line is long, 
stick it out with me, we're better together

HOME _VISIBILITY_

stick it out . with me
we're better together! we're better together!
stick it out . with me
i'll never be better! i'll never get better!
we're better together! it's forever forever forever!
we're better together! we're better together

girls, boys, and whatevers, 
everyone put your gloves together 
girls boys or before
boys, girls, between, and after that - more
women men or whenever
you make me want to say 
whatever, 
fuck it i surrender
come sleep with me, lets rub our masks together
come sleep with me , all November 
come sleep with me , all December
November breakdown 
ximi ximi ximi
December broke down 
fine fine fine
January meltdown 
ximi fine ximi
February through the ground 

x. ADIOS... for now! 

I'm almost certain we'll see each other again in heaven. 
This life is short, and the line is long,

you and me
we can live wherever ever after 
i don't care i'm a cloud
i'll go wherever, your joy brings me pleasure
i stay alone in my home wondering down into somewhere
things have never been better!
i feel more love than i ever have for everyone i know
i feel like i could sleep forever
i feel surrender
it's not so bad when i ain't got the tremors
