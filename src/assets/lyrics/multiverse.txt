lyrics by ZIMM (Mr.Robert Zimmerman)

Why does some stuff stick together 
when other stuff don't stick together?
now why does some stuff stick like glue 
when other stuff it just won't do?

mumumumumumumu

why does some stuff go to town
when other stuff just lays around?
why is some stuff big and round
when other stuff just can't be found

why is this stuff something new
when other stuff ain't gotta clue?
why is that stuff thinking aloud
when other stuff just laying around?

why is some stuff big and bright
when other stuff ain't got no light?
why is stuff so far away
when other stuff is in the way?
