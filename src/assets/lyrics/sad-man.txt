Sad Man

He's come back home and the alcohol is roaring through his veins

He's spent the last year wondering if he's gone insane

​	Living in hotels and buying his women,

​	too many sins to be forgiven. 

​	Give the boy what he's wantin',

​	He ain't hidin' nothin' but everything.

Anxiety pills and overdue bills keep his brain from boiling.

His loneliness and unknown kids, keep him from seeing life as something worth enjoying

​	He used to make about twelve dollars an hour,

​	he wasn't rich but he wasn't sour.

​	Give the boy what he's wanting,

He ain't hiding nothing but everything

____

If you ask him he'll say he's doing alright

but he's so messed up he can't sleep at night.

He needs a little woman to hold him tight

but if he had one he wouldn't treat her right

He's a sad sad man

____

The day before tomorrow came unwelcome

Wishes he could get back to better days

​	He used to have a love in his life

​	Before he went out on her every night 

​	Give the boy what he's wanting

​	He ain't hiding nothing but everything

____

Wakes up in the morning with a pound of pain

weighing him down and making him strain

just to get up and face the day,

Standing right here a million miles away. 

He's a sad sad man
