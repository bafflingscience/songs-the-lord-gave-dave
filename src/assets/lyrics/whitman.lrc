[00:00:00]lyrics by walt whitman
[00:20.34]loaf with me on the grass,
[00:25.02]loose the stop from your throat
[00:29.11]not words not music nor rhyme i want,
[00:33.70]not custom or lecture, not even the best
[00:38.09]only the lull i like,
[00:42.60]the hum of your valved voice
[00:50.55]swiftwind space my soul
[00:54.43]now i know it is true what i guessed at
[00:57.99]what i guessed
[00:59.16]swift wind space my soul
[01:02.95]now i know it is true what i guessed at
[01:06.60]what i guessed
[01:07.68]when i loafed on the grass
[01:10.72]what i guessed while i lay alone in my bed
[01:41.86]i mind how we lay in june
[01:46.22]such a transparent summer morning
[01:50.84]you settled your head athwart my hips
[01:55.39]and gently turned over upon me
[01:59.60]and parted the shirt from my bosom bone
[02:04.28]and plunged your tongue into my barestript heart
[02:08.68]and reached till you felt my cheek
[02:13.04]and reached till you held my feet
[02:20.80]swift wind space my soul
[02:24.73]now i know it is true what i guessed at
[02:28.34]what i guessed
[02:29.37]swift wind space my soul
[02:33.21]now i know it is true what i guessed at
[02:36.60]what i guessed
[02:37.82]when i loafed on the grass
[02:40.92]what i guessed while i lay alone in my bed
[03:12.19]swiftly arose and spread upon me,
[03:16.96]the peace and joy and knowledge that pass
[03:21.18]all the art and argument of the earth
[03:30.00]i know that the hand of God is
[03:34.64]the elder hand of my own
[03:38.99]i know that the spirit of God is
[03:43.58]the eldest brother of my own
[03:47.84]and that all the men ever born
[03:52.62]are also my brothers,
[03:56.94]and the women my sisters and lovers,
[04:01.40]and that a kelson of the creation is
[04:04.91]love
[04:09.84]swift wind space my soul
[04:13.40]now i know it is true what i guessed at
[04:17.16]what i guessed
[04:18.47]swift wind space my soul
[04:21.95]now i know it is true what i guessed at
[04:25.52]what i guessed
[04:26.46]when i loafed on the grass
[04:29.75]what i guessed while i lay alone in my bed
