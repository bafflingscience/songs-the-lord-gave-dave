                    <h1 class="did-you-know">Everyday, David struggles to do seemingly simple tasks, often struggling to remember why it is he must do anything at all.</h1>
                    <h2>w h y ?</h2>
                    <p class="helpingdave">
                    Dave has a psychological disorder which exists within a swarm of accompanying mood, behavioral, and focus / memory disorders which make it difficult for Dave to consistently function in a manner deemed necessary for an adult living in our modern society. <br><br>
                    
                    If one interacts with Dave for a while, one may say "He seems ok. Nothing unusual."<br>
                    It is true that on many levels, Dave is a regular Joe the Plumber next door; He is socially adept, enjoys spending time with his friends and family, and seems to be a well-rounded fellow. 
                    <br>
                    But when left alone, which he usually is, his inability to access the obvious outcomes of daily life choices are akin to that of a little boy of about two, who will grab everything or jump off anything; because what is a consequence?<br>
                    What does breaking an arm have to do with jumping headfirst off of a couch<br>
                    What does a trip to the hospital have to do with picking up a rattle snake and swinging it round and round?<br>
                    Dave will become immersed in learning everything he can about a new skill, which is not bad in itself; the problem therein lies in the fact that the new skill he is teaching himself, will take years before it provides any financial benefit.<br> 
                    But this type of logic does not fully reach Dave.<br>Yes, he fully understands the concept, and does not doubt the seriousness of what lies ahead. But he is unable to switch off his current target of attention and switch it to another. Dave is not an asynchronous thinker and is unable to feign interest in that which does not hold his.<br>
                    <br>He does brush off pending financial calamity, which is right in front of his face.
                    Dave's attitude towards important matters such as this are often looked at with disdain, as if he has the same ability to switch his attention to and fro like anybody else; but that is not the case.<br>
                    This is the heart of what makes Dave a total fucking retard.<br>
                    Dave cannot focus on finance, when there is so much to learn!<br>
                    <!-- <br>But like a dancer with no legs, who knows the moves better than anyone, he cannot dance simply because he knows how. <br> -->
                    <br><br>
                    What does financial ruin have to do with me learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, SQL, React, Node.js, Svelte, and becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker?<br>
                    Well Dave, your dangerous inability to prioritize tasks are leaving you susceptible to some major roadblocks standing in the way of your goal of achieving financial security through self education.<br>
                    There are financial issues, which are not going to just go away. These are obvious and important, quality of life determining factors, which any neurotypical adult would consider tantamount to survival.
                        <br><br>

                    This has given Dave a unique ability to pursue creative and artistic endeavors, and lose himself in them completely. 
                    <br>
                    His inability to think about things like financial security and how he is perceived by others, has allowed him to write songs that make people cry, play harmonica like nobody you've ever heard, and do things on guitar that would be as incomprehensible as achieving financial stability is to Dave.

                    While the majority of the time, Dave is able to function in a manner which is deemed necessary for an adult in modern society, there are times when he is unable to do so. Linear thinking is often unthinkable. Dave perceives time and space in a more abstract manner.
                    <br><br>
                    Sometimes this will be a swirly loopty-loop, other times it may be a half-circle down one path, then a half-circle up the other, followed by a full circle that leaves him in the same place from which he began his fruitless journey. Having accomplished nothing, he traveled three times the amount necessary, incurred an undue amount of stress, wasted valuable time, and left Dave in a state of exhaustion and embarrassment..
                    <br><br>

                    <em>In a stunning admission, our narrator reveals his true identity</em>
                    <br><br>

                    It is me. I am Dave, I have been writing in the third-person this whole time. And I know you are absolutely shocked!!
                    
                    Well, I couldn't sit aside while somebody else explained what it is like to be me. So here I am, I'm going to lay it out straight for ya dudes. Dudettes.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    No offense meant towards the previous narrator, I do attest that the aforementioned symptoms are accurate.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The general disfunction is true, but the thoughts are what drive the mind. And my thoughts are not known to me until they are.
                    <br><br>

                    I could be headlong into a project, when I take a break and look at my phone for a moment. I see a Tweet about some public figure doing some dishonest thing, and three hours later, I am headlong into a deep rabbit hole, uncovering the truth of what some public figure lied about and some other people connected to that public figure who lied about another very important topic which could have great implications into the type of country we will have in the future. I become sick with disappointment and frustration that people are not only okay with this kind of thing happening, but that these people will do or say anything to anybody who is not standing to defend this lying public official. Regular people actively attacking people who are attempting to hold accountable the powerful who have been caught betraying the trust of the defenders of the lying public official. Then reading more and more truly terrible things said by these defenders of malice, all to honor their dishonest leader, who would chop them up and bury them in the woods if it would get them out of even the slightest hint of trouble.
                    <br><br>

                    These leaps into the depravity of humanity have a very serious effect on my well-being. But I am unable to look away, when the lies keep getting bigger, and their ability to turn normal people into enemies of normal people, is continuously gaining momentum.

                    The hatred of Donald Trump has been used to facilitate an array of divisive, unrelated issues. Using an illogical hatred to define two sides of nearly any issue. Issues that should not have sides. Where people are manipulated into thinking that the legislation being proposed, is not an act of totalitarianism, but a way to fight back against the radical white supremacist followers of Donald Trump.
                    <br><br>

                    For now, not condemning Donald Trump is an act of hatred.
                    If you do not agree that he as the most dangerous and evil character since Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin had a love child in 1938 named Dimitry Hitler Stalin, who reigned for 60 years, 400 years in the future, as Czar of the Martian Empire, after traveling there in a time machine invented by the Nazis in 1946; he was very evil...what I'm trying to say is that if you refuse to agree that Donald Trump is just as evil, if not more evil, than Dmitry Hitler Stalin, then you my white friend, may as well be wearing a white hood and yelling the "N-word" as you burn crosses in the front lawns of black folks.<br>
                    Now this new epidemic of "Whiteness" is not exclusive to white people. Which is enough to cause complete and total confusion and frustration.
                    <br>
                    When a large group of people invent a new language that is formulated around an idea that portrays one group of people as evil, hateful, and wrong. While creating new definitions for hate, and racism, and whiteness. It is not difficult to see where this is headed.
                    <br><br>
                    It is racism and hatred under the armor of language. It groups all people who disagree with any of the ideas of the purveyors of the new language, as the enemy.
                    <br>
                    A black man who calls out the hypocrisy and absurdity of the new languageers, White Supremacist! 
                    <br><br>

                    All the while, transhumanists, tech lords, and mad scientists who create viruses that could wipe out our species are treated as philanthropists and heroes. It is truly disturbing watching the world descend into a totalitarian dystopia.
                    <br><br> 

                    I do not know if this type of behavior is what is wrong, or if our society has reached a diabolical state of maleficence. 
                    
                    The world demands more of everything delivered faster with no concern for why or at what cost?
                    
                    Transhumanism is only just beginning. I am typing this using an artificial intelligence co-pilot. And I like it. 

                    But why do I need it?
                        <br>
                    Why can't I take time to truly ponder an idea, without returning from the thought to find I am so hopelessly behind that the world is now crashing down on me? 
                    Why do I have to sell things that people do not need, that do not bring them joy, for the profit of the few who control the merchandise. Those who have no concern whether or not their  products are useful, necessary, or whether or not they harmful. Why is this the way we live?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Why do we follow these rules?
                    Why is it wrong to say "No. I will not participate in this."
                    <br>
                    Because refusal to play this game results in punishment.
                    If you will not play, you will not be rewarded with rest or freedom.
                    And as an example to others who may get any bright ideas, you will suffer, with no recourse to help you.

                    <br><br>
                    "Don't ask why. Do your job. And do it well. 
                    <br>
                    If you don't like it, there's the door.
                    <br>
                    You get a job that pays a reasonable amount of money, provides health insurance, 401k, and if you're lucky, a couple weeks of paid vacation.
                    <br>
                    Now that vacation bit is something I don't like, but I can't just 'not play' the game paying people for vacations, because it's <strong>a fucking federal law!!</strong> I understand the nature of <strong>actions and consequences</strong> you LITTLE SHIT! 
                    When I don't go out and do the work, I don't get paid. I expect no less from the people I hire. But do I get what I expect? Fuck NO! I get men with bigger tits than my wife coming into my office asking about their fucking paternity leave!!

                    <br><br>
                    You're no better you FUCKING WEIRD Little LAXIDASICAL RETARD!!
                    'Why why why why'!! BOO FUCKING HOO!! 
                    There's nothing wrong with you except you got too many fucking kisses and not enough beatings when you were a kid. Your a typical mama's boy! Never learned the meaning of hard work. All praises and hugs for sweet little Dave. Well your Mama Ain't Here to Get You Out of this one you weak, cowardly little drain on society!!

                    <br><br>
                    YOU LIVE IN THIS WORLD!!
                    YOUR WHY'S MEAN NOTHING!!
                    <br><br>
                    OH WHY OH WHY CAN'T I FUCKING GRAB THE TIRE IRON FROM MY TRUNK AND SMASH IN THE FACE OF THAT SOY BOY LITTLE FAGGOT WITH HIS BIG FLOPPY TITS ASKING IF HE CAN TAKE TIME OFF WORK BECAUSE HIS FUCKING WIFE HAD A BABY!! OH WHOA IS ME. BUT I WANT SO MUCH TO SMASH HIS FACE, WHY MUST I NOT DO THAT WHICH I WANT TO DO SO MUCH?
                    <br><br>
                    If you didn't get that, THAT's WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE YOU FUCKING LITTLE SHIT!!

                    I'm so fucking chock full of white rage that my socks are running for cover!, Do you know every day, how many make me want to rip the office door off its hinges and bash in the skull of this commie snowflake or that woke piece of shit talking about equity and social justice? Paternity leave!! A fucking man! But do I run around smashing in the heads of every commie snowflake that pisses me off? NO! 
                    <br><br>
                    The world isn't what we want it to be. But tough tittie momma's boy. It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>You've got two choices.</strong><br>
                    Choice Number One: Do what it takes to survive.<br>
                    Choice Number Two: Keep asking why instead of doing, then sink and die.<br>
            
                    <br>
                    You seem to think that because you don't agree with the way things are done, that you can just not do anything.
                    <br><br>
                    Feel free to do nothing, as you wither away into the abyss of the system as it chews you up, and spits you out, just so it can chew you up some more later on.
                    <br><br>
                    Where's you virtue then Dave? When you're sleeping under a bridge, with NOTHING! With NO ONE! What's your virtue worth when your begging for change at the intersection? <br>Do you feel like you can express yourself creatively now?
                    <br><br>
                    So hows about you pull up your fucking big boy britches, stop rambling on about things that you can't do anything about, and try providing for your children? How does that sound? Piece of shit."
                    <br><br>

                    I understand that questioning the sickness of our society is seen as pointless by many, especially when the cruel and merciless wrath of the collector is lurking in the shadows, waiting to lock me up in the thickest of poverty chains, leaving me imprisoned until every last ounce of my creative spirit has been quashed. With the final flickers of artistic freedom vanquished, my weary spirit dies with an ceremonial whimper. My soul, once a bastion of hope, now starved to death, an empty vessel. My love, lost forever. A cruel end to a cruel journey. 
                    <br>But alas Dear Angry Boss, I believe in reincarnation.<br> And I believe you owe me $600 in the swear jar.
