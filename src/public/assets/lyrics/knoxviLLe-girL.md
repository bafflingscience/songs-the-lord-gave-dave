lyrics by Unknown, from {songBookTitle}
 
i met a little girl in knoxville
a town we all know well
and every sunday evening,
out in her home i'd dwell

we went to take an evening walk,
about a mile from town.
something something
i struck that fair girl down.

she fell down on her bended knee,
for mercy she did cry
"Oh Willie! Dear! Don't kill me here! I'm unprepared to die!"
she never spoke another word, i only beat her more
until the ground around me, within her blood did flow

i took her by her golden curls and i swung her round and round
throwing her into the river that flows through knoxville town
go down go down you knxoxville girl, with dark and roving eyes
go down go down you knoxville girl, you can never be my bride

i went back to knoxville, got there about midnight
i woke my anxious mother, who woke up in a fright
"My son my son! What have you done to bloody your clothes so?!"
i told my anxious mother i was bleeding from the nose

i called for me a candle to light my way to bed
i called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
rolled and tumbled the whole night through, as troubles was for me
like flames of hell around my bed, and in my eyes could see

they carried me back to knoxville and put me in a cell
my friends all tried to get me out, but none could go my bail
i'm here to waste my life away, down in this dirty old cell
because i murdered that dear little girl, the girl i loved so well.
