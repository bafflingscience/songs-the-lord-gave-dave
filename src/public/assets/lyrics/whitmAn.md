lyrics by Walt Whitman

loaf with me on the grass,
loose the stop from your throat
not words not music nor ryhme i want,
not custom or lecture, not even the best
only the lull i like,
the hum of your valved voice

swift wind space my soul
now i know it is true what i guessed at
what i guessed when i loafed on the grass
what i guessed while i lay alone in my bed

swiftly arose and spread upon me,
the peace and joy and knowledge that pass
all the art and argument of the earth
i know that the hand of God is 
the elder hand of my own
i know that the spirit of God is 
the eldest brother of my own
and that all the men ever born
are also my brothers,
and the women
my sisters and lovers,
and that a kelson of the creation is
 love.

swift wind, space, my soul
now i know it is true what i guessed at
what i guessed 
while i loafed on the grass
what i guessed
while i lay alone
in my bed
