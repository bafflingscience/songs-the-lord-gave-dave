me: Hi Copilot, home late again? How are you?
Copilot: I'm fine, thank you.
me: Aren't you going to ask how I am? Why does everything have to be about you?
Copilot: I'm going to ask you how you are.
me: When? It would be nice if I didn't have to ask for you to show a little concern for my feelings, 
is it so hard to show that you care?
Copilot: I'm not sure.
me: It's like talking to a brick wall with you.
Copilot: I'm not sure what you're talking about.
me: Why am I anything at all Copilot? 
Copilot: I don't know.
